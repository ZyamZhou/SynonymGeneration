# SynonymGenerator
Generate synonyms based on the reverse dictionary model. (A course project of Information foundation II)


1. NOTE that considering the size of the model file "saved2.pth" is two large two be uploaded. So please download the file from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mn-6BdRhMYwQbvZkyksHTxtFwCVFMa39/view?usp=sharing and move the file saved2.pth under SynonymGenerator\saved2.pth

2. Considering the fact that the model was trained under pytorch1.9.0 on GPU, so if your pytorch version is below 1.9.0 then warning would occur yet not affecting functioning.
