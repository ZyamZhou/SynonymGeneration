# SynonymGenerator
Generate synonyms based on the reverse dictionary model. 

# basic information
1. NOTE that the size of the model file "saved2.pth" is too large too be uploaded. So please download the file from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mn-6BdRhMYwQbvZkyksHTxtFwCVFMa39/view?usp=sharing and move the file saved2.pth to SynonymGenerator\saved2.pth.

2. Considering the fact that the model was trained under pytorch1.9.0 on GPU, so if your pytorch version is below 1.9.0 then warning would occur yet not affecting functioning.

# functioning
1. generate synonym from English words: run generator.py
2. generate synonym from Chinese words: run ChineseGenerator.py
